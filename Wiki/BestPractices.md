**Managing user expectations**: 
- For best experience
     - Schedule scrums atleast 2 hours in advance so the scheduler has sufficient time in between and schedule the scrums. The scheduler service runs every 60 mins and schedules scrums for the next hour.
     - Install the bot in a team of not more than 100 members. 
- Only existing members of the team will be able to participate in a scrum. Team members added during an active scrum will not be able to contribute to the scrum.
- If an existing team member is removed from a scrum team during an active scrum, he/she can still contribute to the active scrum or end it. The user will not be a part of the scrum from the next initiation.
- Users can setup one or multiple scrums within the same or different channels with a team for different team members.
- The bot does not provide a command to start a scrum and users cannot start a scrum explicitly.The scheduled scrums are auto started by the bot based on the specified time and timezone.
- Any participating team member can end an active running scrum. 
- Data for the last 30 days is exported on the last day of the month to its respective channel under folder name "Scrum Status" for future access.
