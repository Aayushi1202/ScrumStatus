**Scrum for Channels Bot**

Scrum for Channels bot is a simple scrum assistant bot that will enable users to run and schedule stand-up meetings and provide and easy way for the users to share their daily updates. It is designed to work in the channel scope and all the members who have been selected in a scrum team can contribute to the scrum.
The bot works best in typical corporate workforce scenarios, where the team members are not confined to a specific geographic region, span across multiple time zones and are more diverse and remote in nature. Most often than not, in such cases it is difficult for all the members within a team to get together in a meeting room daily and share their updates.

Using the Scrum for Channels bot in Microsoft Teams, users will be able to:
 -  Run scrums in a channel
 -  Schedule a scrum at a given time depending on the timezone 
 -  Select the team members who will be part of the scrum 
 -  Configure multiple scrums to run in different or same channels
 -  Export scrum details for the past 30 days

A typical scrum workflow in the bot will be:
 - The bot will auto start the scrum at the specified time
 - It will respond with an adaptive card in the channel with actionable buttons to share status updates, view details updated by other scrum members and to end the scrum. The card will also display other details like the status of the scrum whether it is Active or Closed, the number of people who have contributed to the scrum and provide actionable insights like the number of people who have marked their status as blocked 
 - Users can choose to share their updates,  view details updated by other team members and end the scrum
